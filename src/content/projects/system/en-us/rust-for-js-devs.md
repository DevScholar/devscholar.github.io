# Rust for JS Devs
This is a Rust tutorial project designed for JavaScript developers. Currently, this project only has an English version. The project covers basic syntax, data types, control flow, functions, modules, closures, ownership, borrowing, and lifetime comparisons between JS and Rust.

The project is currently in an inactive development state and has not been updated since 2024. Development will resume only when new issues are opened.
